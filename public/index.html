<h1>State in React</h1>
<div>
  <p>
    React is a very flexiable library, but in the last lesson on "React
    Components and Props", we ended on that React has a single strict rule:
  </p>
  <p>
    All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their
    props.
  </p>
  <code> function withdraw(account, amount) { account.total -= amount; } </code>
  <p>There was this function we looked at that is considered unpure.</p>
  <p>If this were a valid react component it would look like this:</p>
  <code>
    function withdraw(props) 
    { props.account.total -= props.amount; }
  </code>
</div>

<div id="root"></div>
<div id="boot"></div>
<!-- this is the "root" DOM node because everything inside it is managed by React DOM -->
<!-- can have as many as you like but typically there is just one -->
