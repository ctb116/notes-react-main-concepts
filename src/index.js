// React is very flexiable but in the last lesson we ended talking about React's single strict rule: All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props!!

//There was this function though that is considered unpure:

function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}

// If this were a valid react component it would look like this:

function withdrawTwo(props) {
  props.account.total -= props.amount;
}

// but this is a totally normal thing to want to do. So what the heck?

// convert function to a class instead. this is defined as a class (an ES6 class) instead of a function
//Not going to cover everything in this right now - it is just what is needed to make a class component at the moment..or go with bare bones class

//pretend user Input
const amount = 25;

class Bank extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      account: 50,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Amount is now {(this.state.account -= amount)}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

//This is a lot, take a moment to talk about what looks familar and what makes sense vs what is new and makes no sense. We are gonna go through it step by step

//NOTES ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTOR
// we pass props in because otherwise "props" alone would be undefined. However, it is considered bad practice to pass props into a constructor. There is no reason given https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30571875/whats-the-difference-between-super-and-superprops-in-react-when-using-e Remember coding is all made up by people in small rooms.

// In our apps we are going to stick to constructor(props) and stuff because for now that is what the offical React documentation does and we don't want our resources to conflict with their resources.
// Give an example what a class component could look like

// This will likely get people mad because 25 now represents the amount and it is not clear where that number comes from

// you need super() for "this" keyword to work.
// you could make a class component without a constructor or the super() but it is not recommend. Why?
  // It is fine to not have a constructor if you don't need to intialize state and you don't need to bind methods.
  // a constructor is called before the component is unmounted



// LIFECYCLE METHODS TO CLASS COMPONENTS
// app will start to have many components. It is important to free up resources used by components when they are destroyed.

// mounting - what happens when a componented in rendered in the DOM for the first time
// unmounting - what happens when a component is removed from the DOM


class BankTwo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      account: 50,
      date: new Date()
    };
  }

  //what happens when the component is rendered to the DOM for the first time
  // from the React docs - not sure what this means:
    // While this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesnâ€™t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );

  }

  // what happens when the component is removed from the DOM
  // this and componentDidMount() are called lifecycle methods
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID)
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Amount is now {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const infoPt1 = (
  <div>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>This is a React component:</p>
    <code>
      {`
        function Welcome(props) { 
          return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>; 
        }
        `}
    </code>
    <p>
      This kind of React component is called a function component or a
      functional component because it is literally just a JavaScript function.
    </p>
    <p>It is a vaid React component because it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This function accepts a single "prop" object argument</li>
      <li>This function returns a React element</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

// Replace the arguement in root.render to see each section.
// Try code below and remember to pass it to root.render()

root.render(<Bank />);
rootTwo.render(<BankTwo />);
// When a component is passed  to root.render(), React calls the constructor of the component.
// this.state in the constructor is initalized with an object with the current time
// React then calls the render() method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React updates the DOM to match the Clock's render output.
// When the component is inserted into the DOM, React called componentDidMount()
// While the component is mounted, the browser calls tick() which the component updates the UI by called setState(). setState() call tells React the state has changed and the render() method should be called again to learn what shold be on the screen. React will update the DOM with the correct time. This cycle is happening every second.
// When the clock component is removed from the DOM, the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called so the timer is stopped.


// Use the account example for explaining state in one branch
// use the timer example for explaining lifecycle in another branch

// RULES FOR USING STATE CORRECTLY
// DO NOT
        // this.state.comment = "hello"
        // this does not re-render the component because setState() is what tells React the state has changed and to call th render() method again.
// this.state can only be assigned in the constructor.

// STATE Updates may be Asyncronous
// React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update performance
// this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously so you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.
        // Ex, this is wrong and MAY lead to errors on the next update.
        // Wrong
        // this.setState({
        //   counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
        // });

        // to FIX:
        // use setState() in where it cappets a function rather than an object arguement. That function will receive the previous state as the first arguement, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second arguement.

        // arrow function
        // this.setState((state, props) => ({
        //   counter: state.counter + props.increment
        // }));

        // normal function that is the same
        // this.setState(function(state, props) {
        //   return {
        //     counter: state.counter + props.increment
        //   };
        // });

          // state is already updated in this second example so no room for errors.

// STATE UPDATES ARE MERGED
        // when you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.
        // If you have several properties in your state
        // The merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely replaces this.state.comments.

// DATA FLOWS DOWN   ---- will need to set up a react component with APP.js to have parent and child component
// parent or child component can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless and they shouldn't care if another component is defined as a function or a class.

// State is local or encapsulated and is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it

// a component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components
// <FormattedDate date={this.state.date}/>
// FormattedDate would recieve the date in its props and it wouldn't care where it came from.
// remember props is just an object.
// function FormattedDate(props) {
        // return <h2> It is {props.date.toLocalTimeString()}/<h2>
// }

// this is also known as "top-down" or "unidirectional" date flow
        // state is owned by some specific component 
        // any data from a state can only affect components "below them in the tree"

// example set up the <Clock/> component three times to show they are all their own thing and don't know anything about the outside world

// you can have many stateful components in a React app and in the component tree it is a waterfall of props. components can connect at any point but data still flows down.

// Remember in React wether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. Remember React does not have an opinion about things so designing your App is up to you. Unlike C# that really did care all the time.
